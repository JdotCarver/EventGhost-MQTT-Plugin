# EventGhost-MQTT-Plugin
This is only a mirror of the now extremely difficult to find MQTT plugin from Walter Kraembring (krambriw)  
If this serves as the basis for a better MQTT plugin for EventGhost then all the best. ❤️

*Do not click the link in the description of the plugin. As of writing, it leads to an AI gambling slop site..* 😮‍💨  

- Confirmed working on **EventGhost 0.5.0-rc6**
- There is a weird issue where if you do not have it correctly authenticated, it will spam the log trying to authenticate. Now you know.
